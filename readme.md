## DESCRIPTION
With a simple UI, you can choose a Patreon Marvel character like Tony Stark, Scott Summers, Carol Danvers, T'Challa etc.

You choose a team affiliation like the Avengers, X-Men etc.

You get a bunch of attribute points you can spend.

Finally you choose from a couple of abilities.

Also you can add a little bit of story and two character-images (one for the game, one for profile).

That'll be it.
